Went to Stoller for three years from 6th - 8th grade and was part of many clubs that first sparked my interest in Computer Science.<br>

<h1> Interests</h1>

<p> Solving the Rubiks Cube <img src = "http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/d2/8a/82/d28a821e-e108-6d0d-4da4-fd8e3a74a814/source/1200x630bb.jpg" alt = "Rubiks Cube" height = "150" width = "150"><br>
I have always loved to solve Rubiks Cubes, solving the 3X3, 4X4, 5X5, and other shapes! I still have those at home and do them either when I am bored or when I am timing myself! I spend quite some time learnign new algorithms to increase my speed!<br>
